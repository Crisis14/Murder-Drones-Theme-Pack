## What Does This Theme Add?

### Discord

In Discord App, it will change a couple things: App background, font, user popup background (by clicking on the user's name), user profile background (by clicking of a user's name and clicking the "Profile" button), theme colors, addons for the Discord user status, and the home icon that turns into the Murder Drones skull icon. 

### Opera GX

In Opera GX, it will change things listed here: Discord main font, Discord browser background, Discord color themes, the Opera GX theme on both light and dark with different types of themes if changed, color themes, and the music.

## How To Install Them?

### Discord App

Step 1, download [Vencord](https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord) if in the app or [browser version](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vencord-web/cbghhgpcnddeihccjmnadmkaejncjndb). Step 2, open Vencord Installer. Step 3, fully quit discord NOT close the window and install Vencord into discord that has a green button says "install". Step 4, if installed successfully, go to settings and go to where it says the "Vencord" heading. Step 5, click on where it says the "Themes" option. This will show an instruction of how to put github raw theme links in it. Step 6, if you followed the instructions correctly, then it will display the custom theme in your Discord app. No nitro required.

### Opera GX Browser

Step 1, download the folder of the theme. Step 2, open Opera GX browser and go to the 3d cube/box icon that will say "extensions". Step 3, enable developer mode that will unlock "Load Unpacked" and "Pack Extension". Step 4, click on the "Load Unpacked" button and locate the folder you just downloaded. Step 5, do not do anything with the folder and do not go inside the folders or clicking on the files or it may not work properly. Now click on the button that says "Open folder" and it should load the entire theme.
